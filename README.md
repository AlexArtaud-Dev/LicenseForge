## Modern Open Source Licensing SaaS

LicenceForge is an open-source platform for generating, managing, and verifying software license keys with hardware ID (HWID) locking, expiration date enforcement, and analytics. It's built for developers who want complete control over their license management system with a modern architecture and robust functionality.

## üåü Key Features

- **License Key Generation**: Create unique, pattern-based license keys
- **HWID Locking**: Bind licenses to specific hardware to prevent unauthorized use
- **Expiration Management**: Set and enforce license expiration dates
- **Activation Limits**: Control how many machines can use a single license
- **Revocation**: Instantly revoke licenses when needed
- **Detailed Responses**: Get comprehensive information about license status and errors
- **RESTful API**: Integrate with any application using the simple JSON API

## üîß Tech Stack

### Backend
- Spring Boot 3.4.4
- Java 21
- Spring Security for API protection
- Spring Data JPA with PostgreSQL
- Flyway for database migrations

## üìù License Verification Responses

The license verification API provides detailed responses to help you understand the exact status of any license.

### Status Values (successful verifications)

| Status | Description |
|--------|------------|
| `ALREADY_ACTIVATED` | The hardware ID is already activated for this license |
| `AVAILABLE_FOR_ACTIVATION` | The license is valid and can be activated for this hardware ID |

### Error Codes (failed verifications)

| Error Code | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `LICENSE_NOT_FOUND` | The license key doesn't exist |
| `LICENSE_EXPIRED` | The license has expired |
| `LICENSE_REVOKED` | The license has been revoked |
| `MAX_ACTIVATIONS_REACHED` | Maximum number of activations has been reached |
